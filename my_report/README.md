# Summary


# 1st Deliverable
This work consisted of making an animation following or based on a tutorial. In my case, I dedicated myself only to following the tutorial and I did not modify anything aesthetic. The first half of the work was easy for me with the help of the teacher and my partner, so it was not difficult for me to put the background and the city. I couldn't finish the traffic cone, I couldn't give it the exact shape, similar but not the same.
I continued adding the lights, placing the timline. I had no problems until it was time to animate the car, I couldn't get the car to move. You could only see the first and last frame. After fixing the first car, making the animation of the second and the security camera was not difficult for me.
The next challenging part was the animation of the humanoids.The next challenging part was the animation of the humanoids. I did everything exactly the same as with the previous animations but as soon as I hit play the characters didn't even appear in the first frame. It took me a long time to realize that I had missed a step; I didnÂ´t  select "Apply Scene Offsets". After this point it was easy to finish.
